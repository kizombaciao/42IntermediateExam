/*
We can solve above problem recursively. 
At each node we need information of its parent node, 
if current node has value one more than its parent node 
then it makes a consecutive path, 
at each node we will compare nodeâ€™s value with its parent value 
and update the longest consecutive path accordingly.
For getting the value of parent node, 
we will pass the (node_value + 1) as an argument to the recursive method 
and compare the node value with this argument value, 
if satisfies, 
update the current length of consecutive path 
otherwise reinitialize current path length by 1.
