/*
In this post a new simple O(n) method is discussed. 
Diameter of a tree can be calculated by only using the height function, 
because the diameter of a tree is nothing but maximum value of 
(left_height + right_height + 1) for each node. 
So we need to calculate this value (left_height + right_height + 1) 
for each node and update the result. Time complexity â€“ O(n)

Most of the times, in competitive programming, 
there is a need to assign the variable, 
the maximum or minimum value that data type can hold, 
but remembering such a large and precise number comes out to be a difficult job. 
Therefore, C++ has certain macros to represent these numbers, 
so that these can be directly assigned to the variable 
without actually typing the whole number.
INT_MAX is a macro 
that specifies that an integer variable cannot store any value beyond this limit.
INT_MIN specifies that an integer variable cannot store any value below this limit.
