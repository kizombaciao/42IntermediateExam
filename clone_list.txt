Given a linked list with the following structure :

	struct s_node {
		int           data;
		struct s_node *next;
		struct s_node *other;
	};

where :
	- next pointer points to the next node.
	- other pointer points to any node in the list (another node, itself or NULL).

Write a function to create a copy of this list (allocate new memory).
You cannot modify the structure, you cannot modify the list you are given.

The function must be declared as follows:

	struct s_node *clone_list(struct s_node *node);

APPROACH:
// first, loop through the old linked list and copy each of the old node into a new node.
// next, loop through the old linked list and look for when other is not NULL
// call a function to identify the index location corresponding to the matching pointer address.
// use the index to find the right location within the new linked list
// copy the new pointed address to the new node's other.
